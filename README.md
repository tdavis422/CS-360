**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
Some of the requirements of the application was that there needed to be a login for users to be able to track who was editing which items, being able to add or remove items from the system, and being able to edit the amount of items in the warehouse to reflect properly in the system. The application was designed for users that work in a warehouse or retail store.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
A login screen was required and necessary to ensure users could login as requested by the client. Another screen to show what items were in the area was also needed to be able to show the grid of items from the database. As soon as a user opens the application, it prompts for username/email and password to ensure the user is allowed, after the user has been authenticated, they are sent to the grid screen showing all items. I believe I could've done more to make the screens more successful with the UI.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
I took each piece and simplified the project to allow myself to code a piece each day to ensure I could get the project done each time there was a part due. Using this method in the future allows me to ensure that I can complete every project within a set timeframe.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
I tested the application with a Pixel 3A emulator to run basic tests. Once I was satisfied with the results I was seeing, I ran full tests with my Android device to ensure that it would work with a newer device out in the wild to ensure any bugs could be fixed.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
A major challenge I encountered and had fixed until trying to re-open the app in the emulator was trying to get the app to run and fixing major runtime bugs that keep occuring. I believe once I am better versed in creating Android apps, I won't have this issue anymore.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
I feel like the component that I was successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, or experience would be the grid by allowing it to expand and reduce as needed or whenever items are added or removed.
